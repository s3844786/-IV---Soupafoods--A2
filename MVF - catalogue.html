    <!-- Scenarios with an explaination -->
    <h3 id=#scenarios_explaination>Scenarios & Explaination</h3>
    <p>Fred is a university student currently studying at home, due to the COVID-19 situation, and would like to reduce the time he is in the supermarket. He scrolls through Google Play Store on his android phone and spots an interesting application named called “Soupafoods”. He lets out a sigh of relief and starts to laugh at the name of the application and spots that it is a grocery application which he happens to be interested in, which resulted in him downloading it.</p>
    <p> As he opens the application, he goes through the tutorial to teach him the basics of the app. As he finishes setting up the application, he navigates to the catalogue section as his main goal is to use the application to help reduce the time in the shops by seeing what is on promotion at each grocery store. As he enters the catalog section, he is able to access his local Woolworths and Coles catalogs for the current week and the following week. Out of his curiosity, he is able to add other grocery stores such as ALDI to his “customised” catalogue section with the addition of comparing the prices between two supermarkets of choice.</p>
    <h4>Reasoning</h4>
    <p>The goals of these users all use the minimal feature that the application has to offer which is a designated catalogue section which can be used to access the grocery store catalogues in the current week or the following week. Within this section, the user is able to customise to their personal preference such as adding/removing grocery catalogues they would like to see, compare items at two different supermarkets to understand which one sells it for cheaper and the ability to add the item to the shopping list.</p>
    <p>This will help save the users time to be used elsewhere in addition to providing a reminder of the new catalogue being released and the primary purpose to help the user to save money as the being a customer, we would love to save our money and spend it on other items.</p>
