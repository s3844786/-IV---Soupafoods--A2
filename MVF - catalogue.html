    <h3 id=scenarios_explaination>Scenarios &amp; Explaination</h3>
    <h4>Scenario</h4>
    <p>Fred is a university student currently studying at home, due to the COVID-19 situation, and would like to reduce the time he is in the supermarket. He scrolls through Google Play Store on his android phone and spots an interesting application named called &ldquo;Soupafoods&rdquo;. He lets out a sigh of relief and starts to laugh at the name of the application and spots that it is a grocery application which he happens to be interested in, which resulted in him downloading it.</p>
    <p>As he opens the application, he goes through the tutorial to teach him the basics of the app. As he finishes setting up the application, he navigates to the catalogue section as his main goal is to use the application to help reduce the time in the shops by seeing what is on promotion at each grocery store. As he enters the catalog section, he is able to access his local Woolworths and Coles catalogs for the current week and the following week. Out of his curiosity, he is able to add other grocery stores such as ALDI to his &ldquo;customised&rdquo; catalogue section with the addition of comparing the prices between two supermarkets of choice.</p>
    <h4>Reasoning</h4>
    <p>The goals of these users all use the minimal feature that the application has to offer which is a designated catalogue section which can be used to access the grocery store catalogues in the current week or the following week. Within this section, the user is able to customise to their personal preference such as adding/removing grocery catalogues they would like to see, compare items at two different supermarkets to understand which one sells it for cheaper and the ability to add the item to the shopping list.</p>
    <p>This will help save the users time to be used elsewhere in addition to providing a reminder of the new catalogue being released and the primary purpose to help the user to save money as the being a customer, we would love to save our money and spend it on other items.</p> <br>

    <!-- User stories -->
    <h3 id=user_stories>User Stories</h3>

    <h3 id=validation_criteria>Validation criteria</h3>
    <p><strong>Scenario: Where the use miss clicks on the store catalogue they would like to visit</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Given that the university student is in the catalogue section and wants to view other products that are on discount, when the user clicks on the week/fortnight catalogue specials, Explore more products, then they are able to search for more items that are on special based on the current week.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario:&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <h4>Whole design of the promotional catalogue section</h4>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Derek/whole%20catalogue%20section.PNG" alt="catalogue_section.png" target="_blank">
    <h5>Main section (Figure 1)</h5>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Derek/Figure%201.PNG" alt="Figure1.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>This is the main section of the &ldquo;promotional catalogue&rdquo; section of the application. In this section of the app, the user is able to go back if they would like to go to a different section (whether it's recipes, promotional catalogue, shopping list, expiry date tracker, your pantry or connectivity).</p>
    <p>In Figure 1, the user is able to go back through the logo button, or click on the grocery store of their choice in order to view the current week's catalogue and the next week's one. The add button will allow the user to add the grocery store of their choice and the compare items button will allow the user to compare items between the stores of their choice.</p>
    <h5>Add stores section (Figure 2)</h5>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Derek/Figure%202.PNG" alt="Figure2.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>If the user decides to click on the floating action button (FAB) which is the add button, it will bring them to Figure 2.</p>
    <p>In Figure 2, the user is able to click the back button if they would like to go back to where they were brought from. Otherwise, they are able to search for the stores they would like to add through the search bar and add to their personal section in the main catalogue section.</p>
    <h5>Viewing catalogues section (Figure 3)</h5>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Derek/Figure%203.PNG" alt="Figure3.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>In this section of the application, the user is able to view the catalogue through Figure 1, when they click on the grocery store of their choice.</p>
    <p>In Figure 3, the user is able to view this weeks and the following week catalogue and be viewed in the application itself. If the user would like to hop out of this section, they are able to click on the back button which will bring them back to the main catalogue section, Figure 1.</p>
    <h5>Choosing item to compare section (Figure 4)</h5>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Derek/Figure%204.PNG" alt="Figure4.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>Following the design from Figure 1 (main section of the promotional catalogue), if the user decides to click on compare items between stores, it will bring them to Figure 4 where the user is able to search for the item they would like to compare.</p>
    <p>In addition, this section of the application has sections where the user searches such as Fruit and Vegetables, in order to find the item they would like to compare as well as suggested items that they have searched before or are on their shopping list.</p>
    <h5>Item search section (Figure 5)</h5>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Derek/Figure%205.PNG" alt="Figure5.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>If the user decides to use the search bar to search for the item they would like to compare, the user interface would look like Figure 5. In Figure 5, the search will be filtered to what the user has searched in the search bar where the user can select the item they would like to compare using the compare button.</p>
    <h5>Price comparison section (Figure 6)</h5>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Derek/Figure%206.PNG" alt="Figure6.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>In Figure 6, it will show the item that the user has decided to compare in the search bar along with the different types of variations of the type of item such as white rice, homebrand or sun rice.</p>
