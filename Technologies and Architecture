<h2>Technologies and Architecture</h2>

<p>
Figure:
</p>
<p>
In this application UI interface design, we used Figma, which is a web-based vector graphics editor and prototyping tool. There are six Minimal Viable Features in the application, and each team member is responsible for one. We design and complete each functional interface through meeting discussions, and finally make a prototype. It can help us build our ideal application interface form.

<p>
Cloud:
</p>
<p>
When users use our application, a lot of data will be generated. We want to upload all these data to the cloud to reduce the pressure on users' mobile devices. Of course, it all depends on the user's choice. When the user needs it, the system will automatically upload the data at night when the mobile device is connected to Wi-Fi. After uploading, users can easily view online and make changes (download, delete).
</p>



<p>
Database:
</p>
<p>
No matter what data storage method the user chooses, the system needs a suitable database for systematic management. Users can perform operations such as adding, intercepting, updating, and deleting data in the file. The database will be classified and stored according to different types of data to ensure the reasonable allocation of resources and will not affect the user experience because of the bloated model.
</p>

<p>
Security
</p>
<p>
The security of the data is very important. We hash and encrypt the data generated by the user in the application. First, each user needs to create an independent account password, and bind a personal mobile phone and email. We guarantee that user data will not be obtained by any company, organization, or individual, including team members. When the system detects that the user logs in in a city or country that does not appear frequently, it will notify the user in the form of text messages and emails. If it is not done by himself, it is recommended to change the password immediately.
