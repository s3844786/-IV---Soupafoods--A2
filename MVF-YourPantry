<h2>Your Pantry</h2>

<p>
In this interface, the system lists almost all the foods that can be bought in the market (categorized according to the type of food). The user can use it as a "shopping cart", plan the food to be purchased in advance, and add it to this page. And use this as a checklist to purchase online or go to the supermarket in person. Of course, it is not just as simple as adding the food that needs to be purchased, users can clearly see the price corresponding to each food, and when choosing different specifications, the price will also change. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, we will upload all the ingredients added by the user in the past year (by date index) to the Cloud, and check the market price and food one-to-one correspondence. And the system will draw a table to record changes over time. The advantage of this is that users can check which ingredients they have purchased in the past at any time, and can even meet the needs of the kitchen account book.

<h3>Scenario 1</h3>

<p>
Jerry is a 38-year-old single employee. Due to work needs, he goes to work very early almost every day and leaves at 7 in the evening. If he goes to the supermarket to buy ingredients after he gets off work, it will be very late. Nevertheless, he still likes to cook at home, and when he is free, he will go to the supermarket to buy a lot of food. But because he buys too much at one time and cannot finish eating in a short time, the food will deteriorate and cause waste. This makes him uncomfortable. He hopes that somehow, he can buy ingredients online and cook at home.
</p>

<p>
When Jerry uses our software and clicks on the "Your Pantry" interface, he can view nearby supermarkets and browse the goods and food in the supermarkets. He carefully browsed various foods, such as vegetables, fruits, meat, etc. He found that there is almost no difference in the types of food here from ordinary supermarkets, and the prices are very similar. It also supports home delivery. He only needs to determine the food that needs to be purchased in the mobile app, and the courier will deliver it. These functions made Jerry very happy, and he began to try to use them. Whenever Jerry is an hour before leaving work at night, he will take a moment to search for ingredients in the "Your Pantry" function of the app and plan his dinner. When he got home, the courier just delivered the food so that he could start cooking directly, saving him time to go to the supermarket to buy food after getting off work. Jerry believes that the software has helped him solve many problems related to kitchen ingredients and greatly improved his quality of life. He is very satisfied.

<h3>Scenario 2</h3>

<p>
Tom is an international student in Melbourne. He lives alone in a suburban apartment building. In his own country, online shopping is very convenient. It is no exaggeration to say that he can buy all the products on the market on the Internet, even hot-pots like China. They can easily buy them, waiting for the delivery staff to ensure all the ingredients and soup base are delivered to home... But when he came to Melbourne, he found that life here has changed a lot from before. Online shopping has become no longer convenient, and there are no supermarkets, markets  surrounding areas where he lives. This puzzled him. So, he searched on his phone, looking forward to a software that could solve his problem.
</p>

<p>
When Tom saw our app, he wanted to give it a try, downloaded it and registered it. He found that there was a function "Your Pantry" in it. At this time, the system asked him for GPS permission. He agreed to this request. After only 2 seconds, the names of several supermarkets in Melbourne were displayed, and all the supermarkets were displayed. The variety of products and the price of information surprised him. Tom quickly understood the purpose of this function, and selected some necessities and food, added them to the "Your Pantry" interface, and then placed an order for payment. After about half an hour, a dedicated delivery person delivered all the goods just purchased. In addition, he also discovered the "recording" function, and clearly recorded the consumption record just now, showing the date, specific products, food, quantity/weight, etc. in detail. Tom thinks this can also help him record weekly or monthly consumption. Since then, Tom rarely goes to the supermarket anymore. The food he wants to buy is all purchased online through the app. He is so happy, and sighs that it finally resembles his domestic life before.
