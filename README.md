<h2>Shopping List</h2>

<p>Making a plan beforehand is a time-saving and efficient strategy in terms of doing some things, and the Shopping List function can improve users' shopping experience greatly in many ways.
Firstly, this function can help users to create a shopping list by simply adding needed items to the list. In this application we have provided lots of common items such as milk, eggs, toilet paper ect. However, users can add new items by creating one which gives users a personalized experience. Additional users can mark their favorite items by clicking on the heart next to items so they can easily find them later. Secondly, users can share their shopping list to their family members or friends, which is very useful. Because they can not only add their own items to the list but also if the user is busy he can share his shopping list to someone else so they can do the shopping for him. Last but not least, when users click on the calendar they can add or create shopping lists to any date. This is very useful for special dates such as holidays or anniversaries. So when the day is about to come this application will remind users what to buy for this special day.</p>

<h3>Scenario:</h3>
<p>Jason is a 20-year-old RMIT student. It’s his first year in college and he has not adopted Melbourne’s environment very well. Every morning he takes the train to school and he usually has fast food as lunch and dinner with his friend because he thinks that cooking at home is troublesome even though he is good at cooking. His brithday is next Sunday so he decides to invite his friend to his apartment to have dinner. However, it is now dangerous to shop at supermarkets due to the covid-19. And normally it takes a long time for Jason to shop. So he hopes that he can find some solution to help him to make his shopping more efficient... 
It’s Tuesday evening, Jason’s birthday is coming soon and he needs to prepare for it. A shopping list should be his first priority. So he opened the Superfoods and clicked the “Create a new list”  and named this list ‘birthday’. Then he is ready to add items. He firstly checked the recommended items and added some beverages and snacks to the list. However he couldn't find any hotpot seasoning so he created it himself and added it to the list. After a while he was finally satisfied with his list so he clicked the “calendar” and marked Sunday as his birthday and set a reminder.</p>

<p>This is the main page for the “Shopping list” function, as you can see there is a search bar on the top, it’s for users to quickly find the list they look for. In this main page I provide two lists “My Grocery List”(an empty one as you can see “No item” under it) and “Test List”(3 items included).
