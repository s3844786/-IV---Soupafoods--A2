    <h3 id=scenarios_explaination>Scenarios &amp; Validation Criteria w/ User Stories</h3>
    <h4>Scenario 1</h4>
    <p>The end-user, David is a university student who is currently living on the school campus and shares the room with roommates. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, money has been tight as he can no longer work and lives on a strict budget funded by the Jobseekers payment.</p>
    <p>David looks on the Play Store to find a grocery management application to help him keep track of his purchases and such. He decided to install the app &lsquo;Soupafoods&rsquo; as it was newly listed and he wanted to give it a go. When he opens the app, it prompts him to create an account and to link his social media accounts if he has any.&nbsp;There is a shared user experience feature which allows users to stay synchronised with one another. David finds that he might be able to use this feature with his campus friends so that they can &lsquo;share&rsquo; their pantry&rsquo;s content.</p>
    <p>David creates a group on &lsquo;Soupafoods&rsquo; and invites his campus friends and roommates via Facebook account linking and they repeat the sign-up process for Soupafoods. He then creates the shared &lsquo;Pantry&rsquo; which will be shared with the group. All his invited friends then update the shared &lsquo;Pantry&rsquo; with foods and ingredients from their pantry so that they can share the contents.</p>
    <h4>Validation Criteria 1 w/ User Story 1</h4>
    <p>As a user, I would like to be able to share current information about the pantry with others.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The user would first begin to create an account and then add friends and family on the app. This can be done either by linking your social media accounts or adding them via a friend code.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The user will then be able to select friends and invite them to form a group.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This newly formed group will be able to share their current pantry with the group. You can click on their profile to view their pantry.</p>
    <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
    <p>Andy is a 18 year old boy who is currently living with his mother, father and older sister. He has a part-time job at the local shopping center and usually buys groceries there. He has a passion for cooking so he often stocks up on foods and ingredients.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As he shares the pantry with his family, there have been occasions where Andy thought he had all the necessary ingredients at home but someone else had eaten it or used it already. Frustrated with this incident occurring multiple times, Andy decides to look for an app which will help keep him and his family notified about any changes in the pantry.</p>
    <p>In the Play Store, Andy discovers the app called &lsquo;Soupafoods&rsquo; and proceeds to download it due to the feature called &lsquo;Shared Pantry&rsquo;. He then introduces the application to his family and explains the reasoning behind the use of this app. Upon understanding the situation, Andy&rsquo;s family agrees to use the app and proceed to download the app.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Andy opens the app up and signs up an account together with his family. He then selects the &lsquo;Add Friend via Friend code&rsquo; button which allows the user to add friends by entering the friend code assigned to each account on sign-up. He then selects the &lsquo;Create Group&rsquo; button which allows him to select other users on his friends list to create a &lsquo;Shared Pantry&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now that the group has been created, Andy and his family worked together to create an inventory stock list of their pantry which is updated in real-time for each of them to see. Andy reminds his family to consistently update the pantry list in order for the app to be used properly.</p>
    <h4>Validation Criteria 2 w/ User Story 2</h4>
    <p>As a user, I would like to be able to have an interactive and social experience whilst sharing information.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The user will sign up and receive a friend code and also be prompted to link their social media account.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Users will create a group by inviting their friends and then be able to create and share their own pantry OR create a shared pantry.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The shared pantry will allow users to edit a collaborative pantry list in real-time together.</p>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Andy/2.PNG" alt="link account.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>This is the screen which is prompted by the app for users to link their social media accounts or add a friend. This needs to be completed in order to use the &lsquo;Shared Pantry&rsquo; feature.</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Andy/3.PNG" alt="share.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>These two screens show what the app will display when the user is inviting friends to create a group.</p>
    <p>By ticking the checkboxes next to their friend&rsquo;s name, they can create a group.</p>
    <p>The group menu will allow users to add and remove friends or edit the group name.</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Andy/4.PNG" alt="add/remove members.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>New members can be added to the group by ticking their boxes and then pressing &lsquo;Save Changes&rsquo;</p>
    <p>To remove members, untick the box then select &lsquo;Save Changes&rsquo;</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3844786/-IV---Soupafoods--A2/Andy/5.PNG" alt="share.jpg" target="_blank">
    <p>As displayed in the images, the group created by the user (David) includes Andy. They both can view each other&rsquo;s pantry AND also view and edit a shared pantry by selecting the &lsquo;Add New Item&rsquo; button.</p>
    <p>Both their pantries display the same items because it is the shared pantry.</p>
