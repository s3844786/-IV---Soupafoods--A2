    <h3>Technology &amp; Architecture</h3>
    <h4>Figma</h4>
    <p>In this application UI interface design, we used Figma, which is a web-based vector graphics editor and prototyping tool. There are six Minimal Viable Features in the application, and each team member is responsible for one. We design and complete each functional interface through meeting discussions, and finally make a prototype. It can help us build our ideal application interface form.</p>
    <h4>Cloud</h4>
    <p>When users use our application, a lot of data will be generated. We want to upload all these data to the cloud to reduce the pressure on users' mobile devices. Of course, it all depends on the user's choice. When the user needs it, the system will automatically upload the data at night when the mobile device is connected to Wi-Fi. After uploading, users can easily view online and make changes (download, delete).</p>
    <h4>Database</h4>
    <p>No matter what data storage method the user chooses, the system needs a suitable database for systematic management. Users can perform operations such as adding, intercepting, updating, and deleting data in the file. The database will be classified and stored according to different types of data to ensure the reasonable allocation of resources and will not affect the user experience because of the bloated model.</p>
    <p>The application will need to store both users data and information about users such as the items that they will add to the pantry. In order to not take up too much space in the user's device. In order to effectively store this information. We will enter the users username and password into a database table and assign them a unique key, this key will be used to find the users information in other tables.</p>
    <p>It is important that a user will be able to access their information offline and not just when a connection is detected as forcing a connection will make the app sluggish and unreliable. In order to achieve this we will use a database software which supports offline synchronization, such as Azure Mobile Services or Firebase. While this is a solution it is still not perfect as we will need to make sure that the data that is being transferred is done so in a secure way as shown in this diagram. We will also need an internet connection to save any changes the user has made while offline to ensure that the profile in the database is kept consistent with the user's device.</p>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>The security of the data is very important. We hash and encrypt the data generated by the user in the application. First, each user needs to create an independent account password, and bind a personal mobile phone and email. We guarantee that user data will not be obtained by any company, organization, or individual, including team members. When the system detects that the user logs in in a city or country that does not appear frequently, it will notify the user in the form of text messages and emails. If it is not done by himself, it is recommended to change the password immediately.</p>
    <h4>API</h4>
    <p>An API or Application Programming Interface is a software that allows two or more applications to talk to each other. In order for the user of our application to see what food is available at their closest supermarket, we will need to connect with a supermarket api as we cannot store all items and costs on our database as they are constantly changing we will also need the api to allow the customer to place orders.</p>
    <p>The specific api we will use depends on the needs of the customer we could use an open source API such as aislefinder or alternatively many supermarket chains offer their own api ranging from free to use such as Woolworths to paid. While using Aislefinder would be great for finding specific items at shops it will not allow the user to place orders online as so perhaps it would not be usable for our users.</p>
    <p>With using APIs comes security risks that we will need to contend with as information is being passed between the two applications it is liable to being intercepted so in order to prevent this we will have to come up with security measure as it is possible that private information will be passed such as payment information, we should encrypt any private information using the encryption provided by the API gateway.</p>
    <p>Below is a basic diagram of what a API pathway could look like.</p>
