    <p>For our project, we have decided to use Trello to act as our bulletin board. Our two main uses for Trello have been to assign tasks to each member weekly and to provide the team updates on their current progress.</p>
    <h4><strong>Microsoft Teams - </strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams</a></h4>
    <p>Microsoft Teams has been our means of communication for the team. We have used it to message each other for help and host virtual meetings which have been vital to our project. We have hosted on average 2 meetings per week in order to discuss and give updates on their progress as well as to assign new tasks.</p>
    <h4><strong>Canvas - </strong><a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/" target="_blank">RMIT Canvas</a></h4>
    <p>RMIT Canvas has been our way of getting updates on our assignment details from the tutors.</p>
    <h4><strong>Figma - </strong><a href="https://www.figma.com" target="_blank">Figma</a></h4>
    <p>Figma is a program which allows us to design and prototype applications for mobile. This has been the key to designing and developing the visual features and functionality of our app Soupafoods.</p>
    <h4><strong>LucidChart - </strong><a href="https://app.lucidchart.com/documents#/dashboard" target="_blank">LucidChart</a></h4>

    <p>LucidCharts is a program which we used to create our System Context Diagram. It allows us to create a chart using bubbles and arrows.</p>
    <h4><strong>AWS - </strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a></h4>
    <p>AWS is a page hosting website which allows users to upload html files and then host it to create a webpage.</p>
    <h4><strong>Google Docs - </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a></h4>
    <p>Google Docs is a word processor which has allowed our group to simultaneously work on a document in real time. Combined with the use of Google Drive, we have been able to share our word documents with one another by placing the files in a shared folder.</p> <br>
    <h4><strong>GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong></h4>
